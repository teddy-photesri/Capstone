### 01 - INTRODUCTION

**Project Overview**
- Journaling is an incredible stress management tool, a good habit that mitigates the
impact of physical stressors on your health. Also, a journal helps to clarify our goals
and helps to solve the problems of the past.

- **i-Tone** is a visual mood tracking journal and diary application, which helps you
understand your emotions and trigger.

- **i-Tone** provides several options to help the user understand the influence of people,
surroundings, environment, time and other factors that impact mood which are
called triggers.

- Improve your strength by leading your emotions.

**Problem Statement**
- Journaling is the one effective aid for the depression treatment process. But it is hard for
the patient to focus on writing.

> *“How might we help veterans and service members who are dealing with depression
journaling to understand the problems and triggers in the easiest way?"*

**Solution**
> *Creates a personal emotion tracking application.*

- Also, this can benefit the mental health treatment plan and support the user to
improve their coping skills.
